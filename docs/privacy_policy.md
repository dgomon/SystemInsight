# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: July 20, 2025_

This open-source app ("the App") is developed and maintained by independent contributors. This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled when you use the App.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

The App does **not collect**, store, or transmit any personal information or user data to any server. All data remains entirely on your device.

## 2. Log Data

The App may display log information stored on your device (such as logcat output), but this data is not collected or transmitted. You have full control over which logs are viewed, saved, or deleted.

## 3. Permissions

The App may request permissions necessary for its core functionality, such as reading system logs. These permissions are used strictly on-device and not for data collection purposes.

## 4. Analytics and Tracking

The App does **not** use any third-party analytics, tracking tools, or advertising SDKs.

## 5. Open Source

This App is open source. You may inspect the source code to verify its behavior. Contributions are welcome under the license terms specified in the repository.

## 6. Childrenâ€™s Privacy

The App is not directed to anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted in this repository and, if applicable, in the app.

## 8. Use of Shizuku

This app integrates with [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku), a third-party open-source service that allows apps to use system-level APIs through ADB or root privileges, without requiring full root access.

Shizuku is developed and maintained independently by [RikkaApps](https://github.com/RikkaApps), and this app is not affiliated with or endorsed by them.

By using Shizuku, certain elevated operations may be performed by the app, such as querying or modifying system data locally on your device. **No personal data is collected, transmitted, or stored** by the app as a result of Shizuku integration.

Use of Shizuku is entirely local, and the service does not transmit any data off your device.

You can learn more about Shizuku by visiting [its GitHub page](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku).

## 9. Contact

For any questions or concerns, please open an issue or discussion in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dgomon/SystemInsight).
